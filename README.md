## High-Definition Signal Distribution, Simplified

### HDSDI Video Amplifier  
Versitron's HDSDI video amplifiers are designed for high-definition serial digital interface (HD-SDI) signals, supporting resolutions up to 1080p and beyond. These amplifiers regenerate and extend HD video signals across longer distances, without introducing latency or signal loss. Ideal for live production environments, video matrix routing, and surveillance systems using HD cameras.

### Video Signal Booster  
Our signal boosters are essential for extending video transmission over long cable runs, compensating for attenuation, and preserving image quality. Whether you're using coaxial, BNC, or component video paths, Versitron boosters ensure consistent clarity from source to display—perfect for auditoriums, houses of worship, and long hallway CCTV installations.

### Multi-Output Video Distributor  
Distribute a single video input to multiple synchronized outputs with our multi-output video distributors. These units are vital in control rooms, digital signage networks, and multi-display setups where exact signal duplication across several monitors or recording systems is required.

### Video Signal Splitter  
Simple yet powerful, our video signal splitters allow one source to feed multiple devices simultaneously. Unlike passive splitters, Versitron splitters actively maintain signal strength across outputs—avoiding flicker, noise, or drop-off. Great for small-scale security systems, classroom AV setups, and conference room sharing.

### Video Distribution Hub  
At the center of your video infrastructure, our video distribution hubs provide centralized control of signal routing and expansion. Supporting both analog and digital formats, these hubs streamline large-scale deployments by combining amplification, splitting, and distribution into one robust unit.
